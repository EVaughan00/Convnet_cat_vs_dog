# Convnet_cat_vs_dog
Proving that my teacher is a cat using a AI!

To run, install tensorflow and keras using python's package manager:

pip3 install tensorflow && pip3 install keras

Train the neural net using the data images. 50 epochs gets approximately 84% accuracy. 
Test the nerual net with the predict images. I added my teacher as one of the images along with other dog/cat images to test for accuracy. Turns out, my teacher is actually a cat!
